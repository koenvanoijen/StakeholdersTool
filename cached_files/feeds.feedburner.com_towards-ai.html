Achieving Peak Performance: Mastering Control and Generalization Source: Image created by Jan Marcel Kezmann Today, we’re going to explore a crucial decision that researchers and practitioners face when training machine and deep learning models: Should we stick to a fixed custom dataset or embrace the power of cross-validation techniques? Data is the lifeblood of ML and DL models, serving as the foundation upon which they learn and make predictions. But the question of how to best utilize that data remains a topic of debate. Some swear by the reliability and control offered by a fixed custom dataset, while others advocate for the flexibility and robustness of cross-validation.

<description><![CDATA[Last Updated on June 14, 2023 by Editorial Team Author(s): Ulrik Thyge Pedersen Originally published on Towards AI. An Introduction to the seamless integration of ChatGPT-4 with Scitkit-Learn Image by Author with @MidJourney ChatGPT has allowed for convenient and efficient approaches to constructing text classification models. Scikit-learn is the conventional library in Python to create machine learning models. The combination of the two, with Scikit-LLM, allows for more powerful models without the need to interact manually with OpenAI’s API. Some common natural language processing (NLP) tasks and classification and labeling. These tasks often required collecting labeled data, model training, endpoint deployments, and inference setups. This can be time-consuming and expensive and often requires multiple models to search various tasks. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has given us a novel approach to these NLP tasks. We can employ a single model, instead of training and deploying one for each task, to handle a wide range of NLP tasks by using prompt engineering. Follow along, as we delve into the process of making a multiclass, multilabel text classification model powered by ChatGPT. We will introduce the useful new library scikit-LLM, which serves as a scikit-learn wrapper for OpenAI’s API, allowing us to create a powerful model, just like we would a regular scikit-learn model. Let&#039;s get started! Setting Up Lets start by installing the scikit-LLM package; use pip, poetry, or your favorite package manager: pip install scikit-llm Obtaining an OpenAI API Key To harvest the full power of scikit-LLM, we provide our OpenAI API key. Let&#039;s import the config module and specify our key: # Import SKLLMConfig to configure OpenAI API (key and organization)from skllm.config import SKLLMConfig# Set your OpenAI API keySKLLMConfig.set_openai_key(&#034;&#60;YOUR_KEY&#62;&#034;)# Set your OpenAI organization (optional)SKLLMConfig.set_openai_org(&#034;&#60;YOUR_ORGANIZATION&#62;&#034;) If you want to follow along, please consider this: A free OpenAI trial is not sufficient, since we need more than three requests per minute. Please switch to the “pay as you go” plan first. Make sure to provide your organization ID, not the name to the SKLLMConfig.set_openai_org. You can find your ID here: https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings We are all set up. Let&#039;s make some models! Zero-Shot GPTClassifier Text classification is one of the most impressive features of ChatGPT. It can even provide Zero Shot classification, which doesn’t require specific training for the task, instead relying on descriptive labels to perform classification. This can be done using with ZeroShotGPTClassifier class: # Importing the ZeroShotGPTClassifier module and the classification datasetfrom skllm import ZeroShotGPTClassifierfrom skllm.datasets import get_classification_dataset# Get the classification dataset from scikit-learnX, y = get_classification_dataset()# Define the modelclf = ZeroShotGPTClassifier(openai_model=&#034;gpt-3.5-turbo&#034;)# Fit the dataclf.fit(X, y)# Make predictionslabels = clf.predict(X) Scikit-LLM ensures that the response contains a valid label and if the response lacks a label, scikit-LLM will randomly select a label, taking the probabilities of label frequency into account. Scikit-LLM takes care of the API-related aspects and makes sure that you receive usable labels. It even handles missing labels! Image by Author with @MidJourney Multi-Label Zero-Shot Text Classification In the previous chapter, we saw Zero Shot classification, but this can also be made using a multi-label approach. Instead of applying a single label, scikit-LLM can also mix and match to find a more nuanced label by combining existing labels using its NLP capabilities: # Importing the MultiLabelZeroShotGPTClassifier module and the classification datasetfrom skllm import MultiLabelZeroShotGPTClassifierfrom skllm.datasets import get_multilabel_classification_dataset# Get the multilabel classification dataset from scikit-learnX, y = get_multilabel_classification_dataset()# Define the modelclf = MultiLabelZeroShotGPTClassifier(max_labels=3)# Fit the modelclf.fit(X, y)# Make predictionslabels = clf.predict(X) In the code, the only difference between Zero-Shot and Multi-Label Zero-Shot is which class you use. To perform Multi-Label, we use the MultiLabelZeroShotGPTClassifier class and assign the max_labels; in this example, we limit it to maximum 3 labels. Text Vectorization Another NLP task is the conversion of textual data into numerical representations that the machine can understand and further analyze. This process is called Text Vectorization and is also within scikit-LLM’s capability. Here is an example of how to do it using the GPTVectorizer: # Importing the GPTVectorizer class from the skllm.preprocessing modulefrom skllm.preprocessing import GPTVectorizer# Creating an instance of the GPTVectorizer class # and assigning it to the variable &#039;model&#039;model = GPTVectorizer() # Transforming the text datavectors = model.fit_transform(X) As with any regular scikit-learn model, we can fit the model and use it to transform the text using the fit_transform method. Lets take it to another level! The output from the GPTVectorizer can be used in a machine learning pipeline. In this can, we are using it to prepare data for an XGBoost Classifier, which preprocesses and classifies the text: # Importing the necessary modules and classesfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipelinefrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoderfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier# Creating an instance of LabelEncoder classle = LabelEncoder()# Encoding the training labels &#039;y_train&#039; using LabelEncodery_train_encoded = le.fit_transform(y_train)# Encoding the test labels &#039;y_test&#039; using LabelEncodery_test_encoded = le.transform(y_test)# Defining the steps of the pipeline as a list of tuplessteps = [(&#039;GPT&#039;, GPTVectorizer()), (&#039;Clf&#039;, XGBClassifier())]# Creating a pipeline with the defined stepsclf = Pipeline(steps)# Fitting the pipeline on the training data &#039;X_train&#039; # and the encoded training labels &#039;y_train_encoded&#039;clf.fit(X_train, y_train_encoded)# Predicting the labels for the test data &#039;X_test&#039; # using the trained pipelineyh = clf.predict(X_test) First, we apply the text vectorization; then we classify using XGBoost. We encode the training labels and execute the pipeline on the training data to predict labels in the test data, nice! Image by Author with @MidJourney Text Summarization Our last example is a very commonly used NLP task, Text Summarization. ChatGPT is very efficient at these common NLP tasks and excels at anything to do with language. Scikit-LLM provides a useful GPTSummarizer module that can be used in two ways: Independently or as part of your preprocessing pipeline. Let&#039;s see what it can do: # Importing the GPTSummarizer class from the skllm.preprocessing modulefrom skllm.preprocessing import GPTSummarizer# Importing the get_summarization_dataset functionfrom skllm.datasets import get_summarization_dataset# Calling the get_summarization_dataset function to retrieve input data &#039;X&#039;X = get_summarization_dataset()# Creating an instance of the GPTSummarizers = GPTSummarizer(openai_model=&#039;gpt-3.5-turbo&#039;, max_words=15)# Applying the fit_transform method of the GPTSummarizer # instance to the input data [&#8230;]]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Last Updated on June 14, 2023 by Editorial Team Author(s): Anirudh Mehta Originally published on Towards AI. Source: Image by the author. In May 2021, Khalid Salama, Jarek Kazmierczak, and Donna Schut from Google published a white paper titled “Practitioners Guide to MLOps”. The white paper goes into great depth on the concept of MLOps, its lifecycle, capabilities, and practices. There are hundreds of blogs written on the same topic. As such, my intention with this blog is not to duplicate those definitions but rather to encourage you to question and evaluate your current ML strategy. I have listed a few critical questions that I often pose to myself and concerned stakeholders on the modernization journey. While ML algorithms &#38; code play a crucial role in success, it’s just a small piece of the large puzzle. Source: Image by the author. To consistently achieve the same success, there are a vast array of cross-cutting concerns that need to be addressed. Thus, I have grouped the questions under different stages of an ML delivery pipeline. In no way, the questions are targeted for a particular role owning that stage, but are applicable to everyone involved in the process. Key objectives: Before diving into the questions, it’s important to understand the evaluation lens through which they are written. If you have additional objectives, you may want to add more questions to the list. Automation✓ The system must emphasize automation.✓ The goal should be to automate all aspects, from data acquisition and processing to training, deployment, and monitoring. Collaboration✓ The system should promote collaboration between data scientists, engineers, and the operation team.✓ It should allow data scientists to effectively share the artifacts and the lineage as created during the model-building process. Reproducibility✓ The system should allow for easy replication of the current state and progress. Governance &#38; Compliance✓ The system must ensure data privacy, security, and compliance with relevant regulations and policies. Critical Questions: Now that we have defined objectives, it’s time to look into the key questions to ask to evaluate the effectiveness of your current AI strategy. Data Acquisition &#38; Exploration (EDA)Data is a fundamental building block of any ML system. Data Scientist understands it, identifies and addresses common issues like duplication, missing data, imbalance, outliers, etc. A significant amount of data scientist time goes into this activity of data exploration. Thus, our strategy should focus to support &#38; accelerate these activities and answer the following questions: ▢ [Automation] Does the existing platform helps the data scientist to quickly analyze, visualize the data and automatically detect common issues?▢ [Automation] Does the existing platform allows integrating and visualizing the relationship between datasets from multiple sources?▢ [Collaboration] How can multiple data scientists collaborate in real-time on the same dataset?▢ [Reproducibility] How do you track and manage different versions of acquired datasets?▢ [Governance &#38; Compliance] How do you ensure that the data privacy or security considerations have been addressed during the acquisition? Data Transformation &#38; Feature EngineeringAfter gaining an understanding of the data, the next step is to build and scale the transformations across the dataset. Here are some key questions to consider during this phase: ▢ [Automation] How can the transformation steps be effectively scaled to the entire dataset? ▢ [Automation] How can the transformation steps be applied in real-time to the live data before inference? ▢ [Collaboration] How can a data scientist share and discover the engineered features to avoid effort duplication? ▢ [Reproducibility] How do you track and manage different versions of transformed datasets? ▢ [Reproducibility] Where are the transformation steps and associated code stored? ▢ [Governance &#38; Compliance] How do you track the lineage of data as it moves through transformation stages to ensure reproducibility and audibility? Experiments, Model Training &#38; EvaluationModel training is an iterative process where data scientist explores and experiments with different combinations of settings and algorithm to find the best possible model. Here are some key questions to consider during this phase: ▢ [Automation] How can data scientists automatically partition the data for training, validation, and testing purposes? ▢ [Automation] Does the existing platform helps to accelerate the evaluation of multiple standard algorithms and tune hyperparameters ▢ [Collaboration] How can a data scientist share the experiment, configurations &#38; trained models? ▢ [Reproducibility] How can you ensure the reproducibility of the experiment outputs? ▢ [Reproducibility] How do you track and manage different versions of trained models? ▢ [Governance &#38; Compliance] How do you track the model boundaries allowing you to explain the model decisions? Deployment &#38; ServingIn order to realize the business value of a model, it needs to be deployed. Depending on the nature of your business, it may be distributed, deployed in-house, on the cloud, or at the edge. Effective management of the deployment is crucial to ensure uptime and optimal performance. Here are some key questions to consider during this phase: ▢ [Automation] How do you ensure that the deployed models can scale with increasing workloads? ▢ [Automation] How are the new versions rolled out and the process to compare them against the running version? (A/B testing, canary, shadow, etc.) ▢ [Automation] Are there mechanisms to roll back or revert deployments if issues arise? ▢ [Collaboration] How can multiple data scientists understand the impact of their version before releasing it? (A/B testing, canary, shadow, etc.) ▢ [Reproducibility] How do you package your ML models for serving in the cloud or at the edge? ▢ [Governance &#38; Compliance] How do you track the predicted decisions for auditability and accountability? Model Pipeline, Monitoring &#38; Continuous Improvement:As we have seen, going from raw data to actionable insights involves complex series of steps. However, by orchestrating, monitoring, and reacting throughout the workflow, we can easily scale, adapt and make the process more efficient. Here are some key questions to consider during this phase: ▢ [Automation] How is the end-to-end process of training and deploying the models managed currently? ▢ [Automation] How can you detect the data or concept drift w.r.t to the historical baseline? ▢ [Automation] How [&#8230;]]]></description>

Let&#8217;s take a deeper dive! Source: Gorilla paper Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen an impressive wave of advances recently, with models now excelling in a variety of tasks, such as mathematical reasoning and program synthesis. However, their potential to effectively use tools via API calls remains unfulfilled. This is a challenging task even for today’s state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, largely due to their inability to generate accurate input arguments and their tendency&#8230; Read the full blog for free on Medium. &#160; Join thousands of data leaders on the AI newsletter.

A guide with a practical example Photo by Danial Igdery on Unsplash Do you often have problems with dependencies in your Python projects? Then, Poetry offers a solution for you. Poetry is a dependency management and packaging tool for Python. Dependency management is a fundamental aspect of Python projects. Good dependency management helps maintain projects and fix security issues. Poetry addresses these points by managing the dependencies (install/update). It makes dependency problems a thing of the past, as it always finds a solution if one exists. First, let’s look at why dependency management is so important. Then we install Poetry and look at the basics. In the last step,&#8230; Read the full blog for free on Medium. Join thousands of data leaders on the AI newsletter.

<description><![CDATA[Last Updated on June 14, 2023 by Editorial Team Author(s): Courtlin Holt-Nguyen Originally published on Towards AI. BERT Transformer Source: Image created by the author + Stable Diffusion (All Rights Reserved) In the context of machine learning and NLP, a transformer is a deep learning model introduced in a paper titled “Attention is All You Need” by Vaswani et al. in 2017. The model was proposed as a way to improve the performance of translation systems. The name “transformer” stems from its ability to transform one sequence (input text) into another sequence (output text) while incorporating the context of the input sequence at multiple levels. It was a groundbreaking model because it introduced the concept of ‘attention’, which allows the model&#8230; Read the full blog for free on Medium.
