When you use our websites or apps we may also collect operating system-provided device IDs or user-specific advertising IDs for advertisement tracking. We collect this information using the tracking tools described below.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><i>We collect Location Information<\/i>.

For example, if you don\u2019t feel like creating an account from scratch, you may be able to sign in through an account you already have with another service, such as Facebook, Twitter, or Google. You may link your Flipboard account to other services you use, such as social networking sites, photo-sharing services and media publishers such as the New York Times. The information we receive from these services vary depending on the service and your privacy settings there, but may include your contacts on that social service, and content that you\u2019ve made publicly available on these platforms. If you connect your YouTube account on Flipboard, you agree to be bound by the YouTube Terms of Service and also the Google Privacy Policy. We may also receive Employment-Related Information from a job network or social network if you choose to import your information from those platforms when applying for a job with us. We also use features that let your friends give us your information. We may get information about you from other users, for example if they have forwarded content to you through our website or app.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><i>We receive information from our vendors.<\/i>\u00a0For instance, we may engage with vendors and service providers to collect or provide us with information about you, such as access to location services via wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP address.

How We Use Your Information<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p11\">A big part of Flipboard is sharing content you find interesting. That\u2019s why your Flipboard profile, the people and sources you follow or that follow you, the magazines you create, the comments you post and the content you flip are all public. Aside from that, we use the categories of information described above as follows:\u00a0<\/p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><i>We use information to provide you with services and administer our websites and apps.<\/i>\u00a0For example we use Payment Information to process payment for your subscription(s). We might also use your information to send push notifications on our app and to notify you about content you might be interested in or activity updates. We use information to analyze and improve our products and services. For example, we may use your information to make our websites, apps, services, and products better. We might use your information to better understand how you use our service, customize your experience with us (including the content, marketing materials, and advertisements you see) and to conduct research and analysis.\u00a0 We also use your information for troubleshooting, data analysis, and testing.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><i>We use information for marketing purposes<\/i>. For example, we might use personal information to provide you with information about our services. We might tell you about new features or services. You may opt-in to receive our email newsletters. To learn about your choices for these communications, read the Your Choices section below.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><i>We use information for security, safety, and due diligence purposes.<\/i>\u00a0For example, we may use personal information to protect our company, customers, and business partners and their respective personnel. We may also use personal information to protect our websites or our services, prevent abuse, as well as to detect and investigate activities that may be illegal or prohibited (such as cyberattacks or fraudulent transactions). We may also use information to conduct background, employment, and credit checks and to assess financial, reputational, credit, and other risks arising from any relationship or prospective relationship with you.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><i>We use information for hiring purposes.<\/i>\u00a0For example, we use Contact Information and Employment-Related Information to review your job applications and contact you about employment opportunities. If you choose to voluntarily submit your ethnicity, gender, disability status, and\/or veteran status in connection with a job application, we may use that information for statistical tracking purposes (not for hiring decisions), in accordance with applicable law.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p class=\"p11\"><i>We use information for verification purposes.<\/i>\u00a0For example, we will use certain pieces of personal information to verify your identity if you make requests pursuant to this privacy policy. The verification steps and the pieces of personal information that we request may vary depending on the sensitivity and nature of your request.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p class=\"p11\"><i>We use information to respond to your requests or questions.<\/i>\u00a0We use information to contact you in response to your feedback or other matters related to our relationship with you (such as about this privacy policy or our Terms of Use).\u00a0<\/p>\n<p class=\"p11\"><i>We use information as otherwise required or permitted by law, or as we may notify you at the time of collection.<\/i>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p class=\"p11\"><i>We may use personal information to create deidentified or aggregated data<\/i>\u00a0which does not identify you or any other individual, or from which your identity cannot reasonably be ascertained. We may use and disclose deidentified, anonymous or aggregated data as we choose.<\/p>\n<p><b><\/b><span class=\"s2\"><b>5. How We Disclose Your Personal Information<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p11\">We share your personal information under these circumstances:\u00a0<\/p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><i>We share Online Identifiers, Contact and Account Information, Inferences, and Device, Internet and Network Activity Information with our marketing partners.<\/i>\u00a0Flipboard may work with advertising partners to serve you third-party advertisements, including interest-based advertisements, on Flipboard and on other services.

To learn about how to control how we share your information with marketing partners see the \u201cYour Choices\u201d section below.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p class=\"p12\"><i>We may share all categories of personal information listed above when needed to comply with the law, to protect ourselves, our customers and others, and for safety and security purposes.<\/i>\u00a0We may share your information if we believe it\u2019s reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal process, including to respond to a court order or subpoena.

We also share information for the purpose of management and administration of our business.

For European Users of Flipboard<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p14\">If you reside in the UK or a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), under European data protection law, data controllers are required to have a lawful basis for each use or disclosure of personal information. We rely on the following legal bases when we process your personal information:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li6\"><span class=\"s6\">When necessary for our legitimate interest in providing services to our users<\/span><span class=\"s2\">. These legitimate interests include to respond to your inquiries and requests for information, maintain, improve, and analyze our websites, mobile applications, ads, and the content and services we offer, detect, prevent, or investigate security breaches or fraud, and facilitate the functionality of our websites and mobile applications. In specific situations, we require your personal information to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests. We will use legitimate interest after we have properly evaluated the data processing and conducted a necessary balancing test. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li6\"><span class=\"s6\">When necessary for the performance of a contract.<\/span><span class=\"s2\">\u00a0This includes processing your personal information in order to fulfill your request or provide the services that you have requested, including for example, when you have created a Flipboard account and subscribed to the Flipboard service. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li6\"><span class=\"s2\">\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s6\">When you provide your consent for us to use your information.<\/span><span class=\"s2\">\u00a0In some cases, we may rely on your consent. If we process any information where your consent is our lawful basis, you will have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li6\"><span class=\"s6\">To comply with our legal obligations.<\/span><span class=\"s2\">\u00a0This is our legal basis for certain uses and disclosures of information required by applicable UK and EEA laws. For example, we can pass on details of people involved in fraud or other criminal activity affecting us to law enforcement. Please note that as Flipboard provides a tailored service to each user, it is a requirement of the service that information on your use of the service is collected. If Flipboard is not able to collect such information the service will not be available and you will need to close your Flipboard account. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p14\">If you are a resident of the UK or a country in the EEA, you also have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the collection, processing, and use of information about you.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p14\">You have the right to:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li6\"><span class=\"s6\">Information<\/span><span class=\"s2\"><b> <\/b>\u2013 You may request that we confirm whether we have personal information about you. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li6\"><span class=\"s6\">Access <\/span><span class=\"s2\">\u2013 You may request access or request a copy of your personal information. We may verify your identity before providing you any information. There is no cost to you in requesting to see your data, but please note that we reserve the right to charge you if you make subsequent requests. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li6\"><span class=\"s6\">Correction<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> \u2013 You can request that we correct personal information we have about you, in certain circumstances, and subject to some specific legal reasons where we may need to retain personal information as is. You can also edit some of your personal information through your Flipboard account. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li6\"><span class=\"s6\">Deletion<\/span><span class=\"s2\"><b> <\/b>\u2013 You can request that we delete your personal information, subject to specific legal reasons where we may need to retain personal information. We may also deidentify or anonymize personal information in response to your request. You can also delete some of your information by deleting your Flipboard account. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li6\"><span class=\"s6\">Restrict or Object Processing<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> \u2013 Restrict or object to certain processing of your personal information where we do not have a legal basis to process your information. These rights may be limited in some circumstances under applicable law. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p6\">Please know that in order for us to respond to your request we may require that you verify your identity. For security, privacy, or operational reasons, Flipboard may only respond to valid requests when required by law or regulation. You can also control certain choices via the Cookie Statement and through the Privacy Manager. We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide the services you have requested, including to administer your Flipboard account, while taking into account any legal requirements and tax and accounting rules. If you need further assistance regarding your rights, please contact our Data Protection Officer at privacy@flipboard.com and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws.<\/p>\n<p><b><\/b><span class=\"s2\"><b>8. Data Retention and Security<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p11\">The Internet is not 100% secure. We use standard security measures. We cannot promise that your use of our websites, apps, or services will be completely safe. Any transmission of your data to our websites is at your own risk. We encourage you to use caution when using the Internet. We keep personal information as long as it is necessary or relevant for the practices described in this Privacy Policy, including, for example, for legal compliance, dispute resolution, contract enforcement, backup, archival, and other internal operations purposes. This includes data you or others provide to us and data generated from your use of our services. We also keep information as otherwise required by law.<\/p>\n<p><b><\/b><span class=\"s2\"><b>9. Data Storage Outside the EEA and International Transfer<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p12\">As a California-based company, we store and use personal data outside the EEA. The Flipboard services are offered globally so it is necessary to transfer your information internationally. In particular, your information will be transferred to and processed in the United States where our servers are located. The data protection and other laws of other countries, such as the United States, may not be as comprehensive as those in your country. By using our websites or mobile apps, or submitting your personal information, you consent to such transfer, storing and processing. We rely on multiple legal bass to lawfully transfer personal data internationally. These include EU Commission approved model contractual clauses, which require certain privacy and security protections. To ensure adequate protection of personal data in cross-border transfer and\/or processing, we use appropriate safeguards as allowed under applicable law or regulation.<\/p>\n<p><b><\/b><span class=\"s2\"><b>10. Links to Third Party Sites<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p11\">We may link to third-party sites that we do not control. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the information practices of those websites. You should read the privacy policy of other websites carefully before disclosing any of your information. You access such linked websites at your own risk. We are not responsible for such third-party sites.<\/p>\n<p><b><\/b><span class=\"s2\"><b>11.

If we make changes that we think will substantially alter your rights, we will notify you by posting a notice on our website. Your continued use of our websites, apps, or services means that you consent to any changes or revisions to the updated privacy policy.<\/p>\n<p><b><\/b><span class=\"s2\"><b>13.
